# TODO

- Check overlap with projects and focus them if so on mobile and 1-wide layout so the arrow animates
- Link all sources and clean them all up
- Improve look of initial and final contact sections
- Add all technologies somehow?
- Adding background images for the projects might be cool
- Light mode?
- Resize icons according to the flexible sizes
