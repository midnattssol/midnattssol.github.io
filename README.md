My personal website.

## TODO

- [.] Check overlap with projects and focus them if so on mobile and 1-wide layout so the arrow animates
- [.] Link all sources and clean them all up
- [.] Improve look of initial and final contact sections
- [.] Add all technologies somehow?
- [.] Adding background images for the projects might be cool
- [.] Light mode?
- [.] Resize icons according to the flexible sizes
